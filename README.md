## NFT Drop with Release Minting Page 

In this example, you can create your own NFT Drop minting page just by customising the template with your branding, and plugging in your NFT Drop contract address.

## Tools

- [**NFT Drop**](https://thirdweb.com/igorandandre.eth/ERC721DropRelease): to create a lazy-minted ERC721 NFT Collection that our users can claim.
- [**React SDK**](https://docs.thirdweb.com/react): to enable users to connect their wallets with the [useMetamask](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usemetamask) hook, and access hooks such as [useNFTDrop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usenftdrop) to interact with the NFT drop contract.
- [**TypeScript SDK**](https://docs.thirdweb.com/typescript): to view the claimed supply, total supply, and mint NFTs from the drop.
